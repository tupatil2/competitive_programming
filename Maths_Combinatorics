- a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.
  formula for that is D(n)=(D(n−1)+D(n−2))*(n−1). where d[1] = 0, d[2] = 1, and so on
  
 - Inclusion Exclusion Principle
  Whenever we find some overlap we use this. When entities are odd we add otherwise we substract

  - Count the number of divsiors of some number x
       Every number can be expressed in powers of primes 
       
       x = a^x1 * b^x2 * c^x3 * ... so on
       where x1, x2, x3.. are some integers and a,b,c... are prime numbers.
       
       Formula for finding the count of divisors = (x1+1)*(x2+1)*(x3+1)*...
      
  - Sum of divisors of some number x can be done using GP and above approach.
